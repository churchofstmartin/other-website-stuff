**** 2C (Anne's bio)
Retirement brought Anne back to Davis and to St. Martin’s which she
had  first attended in 1987 as a parishioner. St Martin’s sponsored
her for ordination and then in 1992 hired her as an assistant with a
primary focus on education for all ages. In 1999 she was asked to
serve as interim rector at St. Paul’s Benicia and then later at
Ascension Vallejo.  In 2002 she moved to Idaho to serve as the rector
of Trinity Episcopal Church in Pocatello. 

In her nine years in Idaho she took up snowshoeing and adopted her
first German shepherd. She’s long enjoyed hiking, gardening, reading,
music and conversation with friends. She has 2 daughters: one with a
masters degree in international development and gender issues and the
other finishing a bachelors in interior design. Both will warn you
about playing scrabble with her.


**** 2C (Jennifer's bio)
This goes in 2C Staff / Vestry after Janie's bio and it needs a photo of Jennifer.
 
Jennifer Maloney, Children’s & Youth Ministry Administrator
 
Jennifer comes to California and St. Martin by way of Memphis, Tennessee.  Previously she has worked in both the banking and investment industries. Before moving to California and placing her career on the back burner to raise her two young children, she held the position of VP of Private Banking for Bank of America.  Additionally Jennifer has always dedicated her time to volunteering and giving to others.  She has spent years serving others in the community by raising funds and serving on numerous boards for not-for-profit organizations.
 
“If you have any questions regarding our Nursery, Children’s or Youth Ministries, please do not hesitate to contact me. I will be happy to spend time discussing all the wonderful programs within our church offered and introduce you to the incredible staff of loving and dedicated teachers we are so lucky to have.”
