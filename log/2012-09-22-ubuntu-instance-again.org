From Janet:
I just noticed one tiny mistake. At the vert bottom of 5B Grants

as it is listed above under "regional." Sorry I did not catch that

**** 2C (Anne's bio)
Retirement brought Anne back to Davis and to St. Martin’s which she
had  first attended in 1987 as a parishioner. St Martin’s sponsored
her for ordination and then in 1992 hired her as an assistant with a
primary focus on education for all ages. In 1999 she was asked to
serve as interim rector at St. Paul’s Benicia and then later at
Ascension Vallejo.  In 2002 she moved to Idaho to serve as the rector
of Trinity Episcopal Church in Pocatello. 

In her nine years in Idaho she took up snowshoeing and adopted her
first German shepherd. She’s long enjoyed hiking, gardening, reading,
music and conversation with friends. She has 2 daughters: one with a
masters degree in international development and gender issues and the
other finishing a bachelors in interior design. Both will warn you
about playing scrabble with her.


**** 2C (Jennifer's bio)
This goes in 2C Staff / Vestry after Janie's bio and it needs a photo of Jennifer.
 
Jennifer Maloney, Children’s & Youth Ministry Administrator

Before moving to California and placing her career on the back burner to raise her two young children, she held the position of VP of Private Banking for Bank of America.  Additionally Jennifer has always dedicated her time to volunteering and giving to others.  She has spent years serving others in the community by raising funds and serving on numerous boards for not-for-profit organizations.

*** 2012-01-01 Mike: database stuff
I finally got all the database tables to "compile" into a MySQL
database on my PC.  I've attached all the relevant files to this
message, just as a reference and a backup.  We now have to think
about: 

(1) what we want from the tables and

(2) what combination of PHP/MySQL we need to get what we want.

Note that these steps may require going back to step (0) one or more
times.  I.e., "compiling" is never the same as successful execution. 

I think a good way to start would be to sit at my computer and just
invent some queries.  I.e., let's imagine we need a "Ministries" page.
What MySQL commands would give us content suitable for such a page?
We can try this interactively.  If and when we decide we have the
appropriate stuff in the database and the appropriate command(s) to
extract it, we can try making a simple PHP file and making the same
database queries from there. 

If and when that works, we can gussy up the PHP to give us a nicely
formatted web page. 

If and when we have a nice web page from PHP, we can try to figure out
how to call that PHP from Wordpress (functions.php?). 
*** 2012-01-01 make-db.tar.gz
*** 2012-01-02 Mike: Ministries from database via PHP
I've taken the next, halting steps toward using the database on the
web site.  FYI, I've attached a PHP file that uses the query I showed
you this (Thursday) evening to pull some ministry information out of
the database and then displays that information on a web page.  Have a
look at: 

    http://mikehppc2.gh.lan/~mike/mysql/displayMinistriesAndLeaders.php

or if you're not using my name server (hence, can't connect to
"mikehppc2..."), use the numerical address: 

    http://192.168.1.89/~mike/mysql/displayMinistriesAndLeaders.php

BTW, the "login.php" file mentioned in the attached looks something like:

    <?php // login.php
    $db_hostname = 'localhost';
    $db_database = 'people';
    $db_username = 'mike';
    $db_password = 'xxxxxxxxx';
    ?>

I.e., it's a simple way to avoid having to re-type the login
information in every file that references the database, and it
provides a slight bit of obfuscation, as the pw info does not appear
directly in the main PHP file. 

I guess the next step is to figure out how to do this from WP.

Another, back-burner issue is to decide if/how to unify the two
"ministry" pages.  I.e., do we want to put G.'s extended descriptions
into the database (or into a file referenced from the database)?  And
what about all the ministries that don't have extended descriptions?
Etc.
*** 2012-01-02 displayMinistriesAndLeaders.php (Attached previous entry)
<?php

  require_once 'login.php';

  $con = mysql_connect($db_hostname, $db_username, $db_password);
  if (!$con) {
    die('Could not connect: ' . mysql_error());
   }

  mysql_select_db("people", $con);

  $result = mysql_query(
       "SELECT ministries.name, persons.firstName, persons.lastName FROM
       ministries, persons, relateMinistriesToLeaders as rmtl WHERE
       ministries.ministryID = rmtl.ministryID AND
       persons.personID = rmtl.leaderID ORDER BY
       ministries.name");

 
  echo "<table border='1'>
  <tr>
    <th>Ministry</th>
    <th>Leader Name</th>
  </tr>";
 
  while($row = mysql_fetch_array($result)) {
    echo "<tr>";
    echo "<td>" . $row['name']      . "</td>";
    echo "<td>" . $row['firstName'] . " " .
                  $row['lastName']  ."</td>";
    echo "</tr>";
  }
  echo "</table>";

*** 2012-10-12 Mike: some progress
FYI, I've created a custom page template that allows me to put my PHP
code into a WP page.  At the moment it doesn't integrate at all with
the rest of the environment, but it's a start.  I.e., there's no
header, no sidebar, etc.  Have a look at the last menu item under
"Welcome/About Us".  I'll poke around later on Monday to see if I can
include the missing features (sidebar, etc.). 
*** 2012-11-06 Mike: the custom database tables, etc.
For our reference, I've appended the current contents of the "xstm_" tables,
the ones that I used for the custom web page.

The "machinery" to generate the tables is stored on the ubuntu site:

    ubuntu@ip-10-252-38-202:~/mysql$ pwd
    /home/ubuntu/mysql
    
    ubuntu@ip-10-252-38-202:~/mysql$ ls
    displayMinistriesAndLeaders.php           makeMinistriesSQL.R
    makeRelMinToLeaders.sql.old
    displayMinistriesAndLeaders.php.20121105  makeMinistryLeaders.sql
    ministriesAndLeadersUnn.org
    displayMinistriesAndLeaders.sql           makeMinistryLeaders.sql.old
    ministriesAndLeadersUnn.txt
    foo.html                                  makeMinistryLeadersSQL.R
    ministries.org
    login.php                                 makePersons.sql
    ministries.txt
    make-db.sql                               makePersons.sql.old
    ministryLeaders.org
    Makefile                                  makePersonsSQL.R
    ministryLeaders.txt
    makeMinistries.sql                        makeRelMinToLeaders.R
    persons.org
    makeMinistries.sql.old                    makeRelMinToLeaders.sql
    persons.txt

With a little care and hacking, all of the tables can be generated in about
ten minutes using the procedures listed above.  I'll describe the process
later.  Note that small modifications to the tables can be made "by hand",
using mysql (or similar), rather than regenerating the whole set of tables,
although that does run the risk that the "source" files above will be out of
synch with the working tables.

Note that the Wordpress stuff is located in /var/www/... on the Ubuntu system.

** 2012-11-09 How to increase the upload file size
###### Change the PHP configuration
$ sudo diff /etc/php5/apache2/php.ini /etc/php5/apache2/php.ini.20121109
891c891
< upload_max_filesize = 72M
---
> upload_max_filesize = 8M

###### Restart the web server
$ sudo invoke-rc.d apache2 stop
 * Stopping web server apache2      ... waiting                  [ OK ]
$ sudo invoke-rc.d apache2 start
 * Starting web server apache2      

I believe that in php.ini, we need to make the following two changes
upload_max_filesize = 72M
post_max_size = 72 M
