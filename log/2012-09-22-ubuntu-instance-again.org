Here are the three documents for the "Serving Others" menu.
 
5A What we do.  Needs a link completed to 5B
5B Grants Awarded.  Photo?
5C Davis Community Meals.  More photos?  

From Janet:
I just noticed one tiny mistake. At the vert bottom of 5B Grants
Awarded, the phrase Yolo Wayfarer Center is listed. Please delete it
as it is listed above under "regional." Sorry I did not catch that
before. 

Or we can catch it in the testing phase if that is easier for you.
