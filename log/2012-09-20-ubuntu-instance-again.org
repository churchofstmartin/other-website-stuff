** Create some other pages

* 2012-08-25
** Get ready to move to churchofstmartin subdomain
*** Copy TheTwentytenStm to the-g/.../stMartinTest/2012-08-25-subdomain/01-before
*** In /02-now
**** Move out the images folder to test if we really need it.
Nothing seems to have changed.
**** I don't need the additional add_image_size in functions.php.
***** functions.php Delete:
add_image_size( 'thumbnail', 280, 150, true);
add_image_size( 'medium', 350, 233, true);
add_image_size( 'large', 700, 467, true);

Add the image sizes in settings > media
thumbnail 175 117
medium 233 157
large 350 233

***** Make a new Worship page 
since the old one doesn't have much and it was created before comments
were disabled.
